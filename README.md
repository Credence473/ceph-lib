# Cepheid Photometry
A pipeline to perform photometry on a selected population of stars (Cepheids to be specific) in an image of the host galaxy. 

The `cephlib.py` contains the class and the Jupyter notebooks show example use cases.
In next phase, I may comment the necessary steps in the Jupyter notebook but for now it should be readable.

# Required Libraries
On top of a full Anaconda installation, the following packages should be installed. Creating a separate environment is recommended.
